# 43-H: Covert Optical Identification Friend-or-Foe Using Structural Colour Signatures

> **Part of [Project 43 — Labrador](https://github.com/aaronukgarcia): Exploring commercial and scientific applications of synthetic labradorescence**

## Overview

Proposes covert IFF based on narrow-band, angle-dependent spectral signatures from structural colour patches in the SWIR band. Three critical constraints: covertness is relative to adversary capability; no validated performance specifications exist; and the open collaboration model may be legally incompatible with export control requirements.

## Status

## Key Idea

Passive structural colour patches producing unique SWIR spectral signatures could provide covert IFF markers readable only by matched-filter detectors. The system is passive at the patch level but requires an active SWIR illuminator on the detection platform.

## Target Applications (Conditional)

- Dismounted infantry IFF
- Vehicle/platform marking
- Supply chain authentication
